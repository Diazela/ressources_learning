## Why hackers don’t need your passwords ?

No matter how strong your password or security setup is, hackers and scammers know there’s one vulnerability they can always exploit: YOU. 

- Social engineering attacks use the “human loophole” to get around cybersecurity roadblocks. Instead of hacking your accounts to steal your identity, they hack you by using phishing attacks, imposter frauds, and other scams.

Information security experts say cybercriminals use social engineering techniques in 98% of attacks. 

`So how do you protect yourself, your family, and your business from these ever-evolving types of social engineering attacks? Your best defense is to stay informed.`

Here we will see in surface what social engineering is, how to identify red flags of social engineering attacks, and what to do to keep yourself safe. 

### What Are Social Engineering Attacks? 

Social engineering is the act of “human hacking” to commit fraud and identity theft. Hackers use deceptive psychological manipulation to instill fear, excitement, or urgency.

`Once you're in a heightened emotional state, they'll use that against you to cloud your better judgment.`

It only takes one human error to become a victim of a socially engineered attack. And this vulnerability is the reason why criminals are using social engineering techniques more often. 

### How Do Social Engineering Attacks Work?

Social engineering attacks are relatively straight-forward. All a hacker needs to do is convince one under-informed, stressed, or trusting person to do what they say. And the results are worth it. 

In one of the highest-profile social engineering attacks of all time, hackers tricked Twitter employees into giving them access to internal tools. The hackers then hijacked the accounts of people like Joe Biden, Elon Musk, and Kanye West to try and get their many followers to send Bitcoin to the hackers. 

### These attacks are incredibly easy to pull off, and they all follow a similar pattern.The four phases of a social engineering attack are:

```

1. Discovery and investigation

2. Deception and hook

3. Attack

4. Retreat 

```

### 1. Discovery and investigation

Scammers start by identifying targets who have what they’re seeking. This usually includes credentials, data, unauthorized access, money, confidential information, etc. Then they scope out potential victims online.

For example, they will look at your online footprint, see where you work, take note of what you share on social media, and so on. Once they know who you are, the hackers use this information to craft the perfect personalized attack.

`And because the attacker knows so much about you, you’ll be more likely to lower your guard.`

### 2. Deception and hook

As scammers learn more about their victims, they’ll look for potential entry points. These could include your email address, phone number, and social media account — any avenue by which they can get in touch and open the door for an attack. Then, they reach out with a “hook” to get you interested. 

For example, let’s say you just earned a new job title and posted it on LinkedIn. A scammer could easily spoof an email from a well-known industry website and ask you for an interview.

`It seems harmless and normal, so why wouldn’t you respond?`

### 3. Attack

When the hook lures you in, the scammer executes one of several types of social engineering attacks.

For instance, after you click the link to set up an online interview, the scammer secretly installs malware on your device. `Tiny cybersecurity mistakes like this can cost companies huge sums of money.` 

### 4. Retreat

As soon as criminals complete their mission, they’ll vanish with as little evidence as possible. The average time to detect a cyber attack or data breach is `close to 200 days`, so you won’t even know what’s happened until they’re long gone. 

### The 12 Most Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

```

1. Phishing attacks

2. Spear phishing

3. Whaling

4. Smishing and Vishing

5. Baiting

6. Piggybacking/Tailgating

7. Pretexting

8. Business Email Compromise (BEC)

9. Quid Pro Quo (i.e., tech support scams)

10. Honeytraps (romance scams)

11. Scareware

12. Watering hole attacks.

```

### 1. Phishing attacks

Phishing is the most common type of social engineering tactic and has increased more than tenfold in the past three years.

Phishing attacks occur when scammers use any form of communication (usually emails) to “fish” for information. These messages look identical to ones from trusted sources like organizations and people you know.

`There are three main goals of any phishing scam:`

1. Get you to click a link. 

Phishing emails often include links that install malware on your devices.

2. Get you to download an attachment.

Scammers will also disguise malware and viruses as legitimate attachments. For example hackers will send an email claiming to be from a law firm with a “court notice to appear” attachment. But when you download it your device becomes infected.

3. Get you to enter your credentials on a website.

Many times, hackers will try to get you to go to a legitimate-looking website and enter credentials. For example, they’ll send you an email saying an online account was compromised and to change your password.

Stolen credentials and malware can lead to everything from identity theft to financial fraud, account takeovers, corporate espionage, and more.

`Pro tip: Install antivirus software that will warn you about phishing sites and malware.`

### 2. Spear phishing 

Normal phishing attacks have no specific target. But spear phishing attacks occur when hackers target a specific individual or organization. 

`Nearly 60% of IT decision-makers believe targeted phishing attacks are their top security threat.`

This occurs when scammers impersonate customer service accounts on social media with the goal of getting you to send them your login information.

### 3. Whaling

Whaling is a term used to describe phishing attacks that target a specific, high-profile person. Usually, an executive, government official, or celebrity. The victims of whaling attacks are considered “big fish” to cybercriminals.

The victims of whaling attacks are considered “big fish” to cybercriminals. These targets offer great potential to scammers with either large financial payouts or access to valuable data.

The sender claims to know confidential information about a coworker — but is afraid to report the situation in person. Instead, they’ll share their evidence as a spreadsheet, PDF, or slide deck. But when victims click the link, they’re taken to a malicious website.

And if they try to open the attachment, malware infects their system and spreads to their network.

`Pro tip: Protect your devices from malware using antivirus software. Antivirus software protects your devices and networks from malicious attacks.`

### 4. Smishing (SMS phishing) and vishing (voice phishing)

Phishing isn’t always limited to emails and fraudulent websites. Smishing is the term used to describe phishing via the use of SMS text messages.

Scammers purchase spoofed phone numbers and blast out messages containing malicious links. There’s also vishing, which is the same as phishing but done over the phone. Vishing is especially widespread in businesses.

Scammers will contact a company’s front desk, customer service, HR, or IT and claim to need personal information about an employee. `Lies range from mortgage lenders trying to “verify” email addresses to executive assistants requesting password changes on their boss’s behalf.`

### 5. Baiting

Baiting is a type of social engineering attack in which scammers lure victims into providing sensitive information by promising them something valuable in return. 

For example, scammers will create pop-up ads that offer free games, music, or movie downloads. If you click on the link, your device will be infected with malware. 

Baiting scams also exist in the physical world. 

One common example is a strategically placed USB stick with an enticing label like “Payroll Q3” or “Master client database.”

A curious employee will pick up the drive and insert it into their workstation, `which then infects their entire network`.

### 6. Piggybacking / Tailgating

Piggybacking and tailgating both refer to a type of attack in which an authorized person allows an unauthorized person access to a restricted area.

This form of social engineering may happen at your place of work if you let someone follow you into the building. Or, it could happen at your apartment building as you’re leaving for the day.

Scammers may be dressed as delivery drivers, say they forgot their IDs, or pretend that they’re “new.” Once inside, they can spy on people, access workstations, check the names on mailboxes, and more. 

Tailgating also includes giving unauthorized users (like a coworker or child) access to your company devices. They may put your device at risk and spread malicious code throughout `the rest of your company`.

### 10. Honeytraps (romance scams)

Honeytraps are a type of romance scam in which scammers create fake online dating and social media profiles using attractive stolen photos.

For example, in a military romance scam the fraudster will pose as an active service member stationed far away and unable to meet in person. Once they identify a target they’ll start sending flirty and provocative messages and quickly tell their victims they’re in love with them.

But, they need the victims to prove they feel the same way by sending gifts, cash or cryptocurrency. Honeytraps are especially rampant on social media sites like Snapchat. `Make sure you're always staying safe and are aware of the dangers of online dating.`

### 11. Scareware

Scareware — also known as fraudware, deception software, and rogue scanner software — frightens victims into believing they’re under imminent threat. 

For example, you could receive a message saying that your device has been infected with a virus.

Scareware often appears as pop-ups in your browser. It can also appear in spam emails. Victims are supposed to click on a button to either remove the virus or download software that will uninstall the malicious code.

But doing so `is what causes the actual malicious software to get in.`

### 12. Watering hole attacks

A watering hole attack occurs when hackers infect a site that they know you regularly visit. 

When you visit the site, you automatically download malware (known as a drive-by-download). Or, you'll be taken to a fake version of the site that is designed to steal your credentials. 

For example, scammers could divert you away from a normal login page to one designed to steal your account name and password. It will look exactly the same. But anything you enter will go straight to the scammer. 

`This is where having a password manager becomes so important`. Even if a phishing site looks exactly like the real one, a password manager won’t automatically enter your credentials. 

---------------------------------------------------------

## The Bottom Line: Human Hacking Can Be Avoided

Most people are aware of large-scale social engineering attacks. Yet they have trouble picturing how those same attacks could ruin their own reputations, families, and businesses.

Anyone can become a victim of cleverly-designed social engineering techniques. And simple human error has the potential to pack a devastating punch.

Learning how to spot all types of social engineering attacks is the `first step`. 

For added protection, consider `identity theft and device protection tools.`
